## Task 4

First declare two Int variables. Then divided the first variable by the second and assign the result to a variable named $VariableResult.

The easiest way to do this is within the Integrated Scripting Environment
(ISE) using multiple lines of code.

Typecast a Variable as a “String” and assign it a value of 5.
